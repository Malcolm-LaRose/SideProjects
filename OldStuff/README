Most of the things here are either on a long term hiatus or are retired indefinitely. I try to only put half working and obsolesced programs in here, which occurs semi-frequently as I try out new API's. 

That does not mean that everything outside of this folder is working, complete, up to date, or even a current project. If it's still out there, it's a work in progress, and I won't separate complete programs from the rest yet.
